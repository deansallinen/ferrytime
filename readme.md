# Ferry Tracker

A simple ~~website~~ webapp to track the schedule of the BC Ferries.

What began as a re-styled HTML table ended up becoming a pet project learning environment for front-end development.

- Started in Ruby with Sinatra and Twitter Bootstrap (2013)
- Re-wrote everything in Node, Express, and Handlebars (2017)
- Tried using MongoDB instead of _gasp_ writing JSON to disk (2018)
- Moved to SQLite3 and Sequelize for future features
- Added React as a front-end framework with Styled-Components for CSS
- Moved to Postgres for Database
- Tried using Knex as ORM
- Fell back to using pg-promise and writing SQL for simplicity

## TODO

See project page in Github.
